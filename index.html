            <h2>About me</h2>
            <article>
                <p>I introduce myself as a Project Engineer with a solid background in the construction industry, characterized by my meticulous approach to project planning, execution and supervision. My experience ranges from initial conceptualization to final delivery, always with a firm commitment to efficiency, resource optimization and compliance with the highest standards of quality and safety.</p>
                
                <p>I have developed a great ability for the integrated management of multidisciplinary teams and the coordination of suppliers, which has allowed me to successfully complete projects of various sizes. I consider myself a proactive person, with a proven ability to solve problems in an innovative way and adapt quickly to dynamic environments, essential characteristics for remote work, In parallel, the experience of being a mother of a 4-year-old girl has cultivated in me an exceptional capacity for organization and time management, prioritizing tasks and keeping calm under pressure, qualities that I consider crucial for success in a remote work environment.</p>

                <p>My work environment, extends beyond the professional environment; I am interested in new technologies applied to the industry, such as BIM modeling and cloud-based project management, constantly looking for ways to integrate these tools to improve productivity and communication in distributed environments. I aspire to be part of a company that values autonomy, initiative and effective remote collaboration, where I can apply my experience and knowledge to face new challenges and contribute to mutual growth. My goal is to continue developing innovative solutions that optimize construction processes and, in the long term, to be able to lead flagship projects that leave a positive impact on the global infrastructure, demonstrating that distance is not an impediment to excellence and the achievement of ambitious goals.</p>
